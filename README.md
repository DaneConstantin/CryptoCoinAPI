<h2>About the project</h2>

<p><b>CryptaFlux</b> is a website that allows users to search for information about various cryptocurrencies in real-time. The website is designed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date information about the price, market cap, trading volume, and other key metrics of cryptocurrencies. <br/>
<p> Work Date: October 2023</p>
The website is connected to the Coingecko API, which is a popular source of data for cryptocurrency information. <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentation" style="color:green">CoinGecko API</a> provides the most comprehensive & reliable crypto data through RESTful JSON endpoints. Thousands of forward-thinking projects, Web3 developers, researchers, institutions, and enterprises use our API to obtain price feeds, market data, metadata, and historical data of crypto assets, NFTs, and exchanges.
